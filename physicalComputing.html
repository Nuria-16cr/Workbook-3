          <h2>Arduino Components</h2>
          <p>
            Our best guess of Arduino components, looking back at these
            exercises I can confidently recognise majority of this components,
            how they could be used in with an Arduino and how they are utilised
            in real life. Some examples include sensors are used in cars to
            detect if they are too close to an object. LEDs are used all over
            including Christmas lights and devices. The receiver is placed on
            TVs to receive input from remote controls 180 motors are used for
            windscreen wipers. Screens for digital watches and temp and humidity
            sensors are used for heating and cooling systems.

          <h2>Light Sensor</h2>
          <p>
            The circuit is composed of a light sensor and a tone speaker, the
            Arduino reads the amount of light in the room and maps that data
            into a set of numbers, from that data the numbers are grouped into
            different tones. The output results in varying musical tones
            depending on the light received.

          <h2>Light Sensor II</h2>
          <p>
            Similarly to the light receptor into tone circuit, the following
            circuit triggers the 180-degree servo. It’s achieved in the same
            manner with the Arduino mapping the light input, the information
            triggers the motor which turns 180 degrees.

          <h2>Galvanic Response</h2>
          <p>
            The circuit above utilises galvanic skin response, we are conductors
            of electricity, we do so though the sweat and electrical
            conductivity of the skin. For this this circuit each cable is
            attached to a potato, orange, and aluminium foil, each of this
            conduct electricity differently, the more water it contains the more
            electricity it will conduct, in this case aluminium being a metal
            will also be a good conductor due to its atomic structure. By
            touching the circuit, we become part of the circuit, disturbing the
            conductivity, this disturbance is recognised by the Arduino which
            maps the electric current to a tone.

          <h2>Arduino and Processing</h2>
          <p>
            In week 9 we utilised the Arduino’s dial to manipulate a sketch made
            in P5.js, my aim was to make the circle change colour depending on
            the mapped data, I was able to successfully turn the square into a
            square, change the background colour, change the position of the
            mapped data and the data in which changed the colour and size,
            unfortunately I did not achieve different colours based on rotation
            with the limited class time we had.
