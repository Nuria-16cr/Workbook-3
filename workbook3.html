          For my workbook 3 I still wanted to play into the idea of fantasy, I
          liked the dark colours that I had on the first page of my workbook 2
          so I keep the moody mysterious vibe, but I updated it slightly.<br /><br />
          I planned out the layout of my html pages with the content to get an
          idea of what each was going to look like and to type all the content
          out. The layout was then changed as I was finding it hard to do the
          grid format. All the pages have a horizontal format except the
          "gallery" one which I decided to create in a separate CSS to avoid
          confusion. The main thing that I focused when working on this workbook
          was creating a lot more classes, and classes that would be able to
          reuse. From my previous workbooks I kept coming up with errors as I
          was missing CSS info such as, position and justify-content so I aimed
          to be as thorough as possible when setting the parameters for my
          classes. However, once I had one page styled, I was able to copy the
          layout with minor changes, another major addition to my CSS was media
          queries so it the website is responsive at all sizes.<br /><br />
          Animating the ring was the biggest challenge as my experience with
          JavaScript is limited, I initially tried to animate it with CSS
          keyframes but was not able to create the effect I wanted. There are
          lots of tutorials online that animate rings as loading elements, so I
          was able to use some of that code on how to calculate the centre of
          the ring and the movement of the balls. I have not sourced any of the
          videos as I watched a lot of them and didn't end up copying any of
          their code directly, but they gave me a good idea of what was need for
          objects to move around a circle and how to make the animation
          infinite. I used some AI to tailor the animation to my website and to
          recover from errors. <br /><br />One of the problems I ran into was I
          initially had 8 balls so I defined it, 'const numBalls = 8; but when
          wanted to add more balls it would no longer work so JavaScript now
          creates an array depending on how many items in the class
          .small-circle there is: const balls =
          Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(".small-circle"));
