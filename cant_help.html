          Can't help myself is a robot installation that frantically scrapes its
          fluid back into itself. This work is very impactful as has a human
          resemblance; the red liquid appears like blood there is a certain
          frantic and desperate characteristic about the robot trying to
          maintain its fluid inside when its own movement is what it forcing it
          back out.
