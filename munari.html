          Bruno Munari was an Italian artist, designer and inventor who sought
          to make design more playful and accessible.<br /><br />
          He started developing his machines in 1930s, they were small
          structures design to move gently and not perform any kind of task.<br /><br />
          The images above are sketches for potential 'useless machines', I like
          his humour and overcomplication of simple tasks. This ridiculous
          machines spark so much imagination, not everything need to be hyper
          functional, I think we are taught to fixate on design that it is
          intuitive, accessible and will essentially 'make our life easier', we
          forget the endless possibilities of the designing without the
          limitations of functionality, and the beauty that there is in making a
          machine or an interactive object which its intent was never to
          optimise a performance. This subject in general has really brought me
          out of my comfort zone in this sense, I fear I have always looked for
          a way to make things functional and intuitive and miss I miss out on
          all the opportunities of having a design exist sole in its creativity
          and originality. With all this exposure to designs so rich in
          creativity and originality I have set the aim try and incorporate more
          playfulness in my own designs even if they do hinder productivity.
